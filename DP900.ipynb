    "Normalizing a database reduces data redundancy - Yes\n",
    "Normalization improves data integrity - Yes\n",

    "3. An extract, transform, and load (ETL) process requires\n",
    "    - ~~a matching schema in the data source and the data target~~\n",
    "    - <span style = \"color: red\">data that is fully processed before being loaded to the target data store</span>\n",
    "    - Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is a data pipeline used to collect data from various sources, transform the data according to business rules, and load it into a destination data store.\n",

    "4. In batching process, \n",
    "    - latency in delivering data processing results is acceptable \n",
    "    - When to use batch processing, You might expect latencies when using batch processing. For many situations, however, this type of delay before the transfer of data begins is not a big issue - the processes that use this function are not mission critical at the exact moment.\n",

    "- The data model is a star schema\n",
    "- Customer is a dimension table\n",
    " - In computing, the star schema is the simplest style of data mart schema and is the approach most widely used to develop data warehouses and dimensional data marts. The star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.\n",

    "    - Batch processing can output data to a NoSQL database - Yes \n",
    "    - Big data solutions often use long-running batch jobs to filter, aggregate, and otherwise prepare the data for analysis. Usually these jobs involve reading source files from scalable storage (like HDFS, Azure Data Lake Store, and Azure Storage), processing them, and writing the output to new files in scalable storage.\n",
